Hello! This document will help you get started using Hex Engine to create a 2D game for the browser.

This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript.

To begin, you'll first need to install these prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A web browser. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)'s canvas is pretty fast, so that's what we recommend- but your game will work in any modern web browser.
- A code editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience, but anything that can edit plain text files will work.

Once you've got those installed, you can continue onward to [First Time Setup](/docs/first-time-setup).
