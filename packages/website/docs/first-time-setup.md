## Creating the Project

To quickly scaffold out a template game using Hex Engine, you can use the npm package `create-hex-engine-game`. Pick a directory where you want to make your game, then run the following in a terminal emulator or command prompt:

```
npx create-hex-engine-game@latest my-game
```

You can change `my-game` to whatever you want; that's the name of the folder where it's going to put everything.

It will run some tasks, and then let you know when it's done. Once it is, go open up that `my-game` directory (or whatever else you named it- for the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume you named it `my-game`, though).

## Exploring the Project

Inside the directory, you'll see a structure like this:

```
my-game
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── src
    ├── Box.ts
    ├── Draggable.ts
    ├── Floor.ts
    ├── Root.ts
    └── index.ts
```

You may notice those `.ts` files- these are [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) files.
If you're not familiar with TypeScript, don't worry! TypeScript usage in Hex Engine is _entirely optional_. That said, it's also _highly recommended_. Hex Engine's API has been designed to make your TypeScript exposure **as little and as painless as possible**. However, if you prefer to use plain JavaScript instead of TypeScript, you can rename those files so they end with `.js`.

Before we dig into the code, let's start up a local development server and see what we have so far in the browser. To do so, use a terminal emulator or command prompt to `cd` to your project directory (`my-game`, unless you changed it), then run this command within:

```
npm start
```

This will start a local web server running on your computer that you can use to develop your game. To connect to it, open up your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

When you do, you'll see something like this:

You can click and drag on the red box to move it around. When you let it go, it will fall back down.

## The Inspector Bar

You may also notice the inspector bar in the upper-right:

![Screenshot of the inspector bar. There is a "pause" button on the left, a "Running" label in the middle, and an "Expand" button on the right.](/img/inspector-bar.png)

This inspector bar is a useful debugging tool. It won't be present in your final game, though- it's just here for while you're working on it.

If you click the "Pause" button, the game will be paused, and the UI changes so you can step through the game frame-by-frame. This can be really helpful when debugging.

![Screenshot of the inspector bar after clicking Pause. There is now a "Play" button on the left, and an "advance to next frame" button beside that. The middle label has changed to say "Paused (frame 2242)". The expand button on the right is still present.](/img/inspector-bar-paused.png)

If you click the "Expand" button on the right, the inspector overlay pane will open, revealing a hierarchy view showing all the Entities currently loaded in the game.

Try expanding `root` > `children` > `1` > `components` > `6`. This is the `Geometry` component for the red box. It's not important right now what a Geometry component is; for now, try dragging the box around with the inspector pane open. You should see the `position` property on the `Geometry` component update. Pretty cool, eh?

Now try expanding `root` > `children` > `0` > `components` > `6`. This is the `Geometry` component for the gray floor. Expand its `position` property and find its `x` and `y` properties. Try editing the properties; you should see the gray floor move around.

The inspector bar and inspector overlay pane are both invaluable tools not just for understanding what's going on in your game, but also for playing around with it.

In the next section, we'll dig into the code to get a better handle on what's going on.
