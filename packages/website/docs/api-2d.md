`@hex-engine/2d` is the main package that you will interact with when using Hex Engine. It has several named exports, which are each documented here.

> NOTE: `@hex-engine/2d` also re-exports everything from [`@hex-engine/core`], but those exports are not documented here. Check the API documentation for [`@hex-engine/core`] if you can't find what you're looking for here.

## Models

`@hex-engine/2d` includes several "Models", which are classes representing common data structures that are used throughout the library.

If you want to provide a Vector to other parts of the code but do not want it to be mutated, you can use this interface.

Note that even though it's called ReadOnlyVector, the real underlying instance at runtime is still a normal, mutable Vector. This is just a TypeScript interface intended for documentation/warning purposes so that consumers can understand whether they are allowed to mutate a received Vector or not.

### Polygon

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts

The points are ordered such that one could draw the polygon by
placing a pen down at the first point, then dragging the pen in a straight line
to the second point, then the third, and so on until the last point,
which is connected to the first point.

Note that the x and y values on the points on the created Polygon
may not be the same as the x and y values on the points you give here,
because the constructor calculates the centroid of the polygon and then
recenters all points around it.

##### rectangle

Their `x` and `y` properties refer to their position relative to the
polygon's [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid).

The points are ordered such that one could draw the polygon by
placing a pen down at the first point, then dragging the pen in a straight line
to the second point, then the third, and so on until the last point,
which is connected to the first point.

This Component can be placed on the root Entity to specify the draw order that the
`Canvas` Component will use. If no `Canvas.DrawOrder` Component is present on the
root Entity, then `Canvas.DrawOrder.defaultSort` will be used as the sort order.

```ts
function DrawOrder(
  sort: (entities: Array<Entity>) => Array<Component>
): {
  sort: (entities: Array<Entity>) => Array<Component>;
};
```

```ts
import mySound from "./my-sound.ogg";

console.log(typeof mySound); // "string"

useNewComponent(() => Audio({ url: mySound }));
```

When you import an audio clip in this way, it will be automatically
added to the build and included in the final build output.

```ts
function Audio({
  url,
}: Props): {
  /**
   * Play this audio clip, if it's loaded. If it isn't loaded yet, nothing will happen.

import { AudioContext } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

A Component to be placed on the root Entity, which creates a Web Audio API
`AudioContext` upon first user interaction with the page.

Web browsers disallow playback of audio prior to user interaction, which is
why this Component waits until the first click or keypress to come from the user
before creating an AudioContext.

```ts
function AudioContextComponent(): {
  /**
   * The Web Audio API AudioContext instance, if it's been created yet.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.1
   */

```ts
import { ImageFilter } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

This Component uses the canvas `getImageData` and `putImageData` APIs
to filter the contents of a Canvas by passing it through a filter function.

Note: `getImageData` and `putImageData` are very slow, so if you can,
try not to call this every frame.

```ts
function ImageFilter(
  filter: (data: ImageData) => void
): {
  /**
   * Reads the pixels in `input` into an ImageData object, passes that `ImageData`
   * object into the filter this ImageFilter Component was constructed with,

### LowLevelMouse

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { LowLevelMouse } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

A low-level Mouse Component. It provides an interface for mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, mouseover, and mouseout events on the canvas. The positions on these events can be reported either relative to the entity, relative to the world, or relative to the screen, depending on what is desired. Use the `positionsRelativeTo` option when constructing the component to choose.

For click events, information about whether the cursor is within an Entity's geometry,
and clean separation between left-click, right-click, and middle-click events, use `Mouse` instead.

> If you need to convert an Entity-local position to a world position, you can use the following code snippet:
>
> ```ts
> const worldPoint = useEntityTransforms()
>   .matrixForWorldPosition()
>   .transformPoint(localPoint);
> ```
>
> And if you need to go the other way, you can use the following snippet:
>
> ```ts
> const localPoint = useEntityTransforms()
>   .matrixForWorldPosition()
>   .inverse()
>   .transformPoint(worldPoint);
> ```

> In versions prior to 0.0.1, this component was called `Mouse`.

### Mouse

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { Mouse } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

A Component that gives you information about where the Mouse is, relative to the current Entity,
and lets you register functions to be called when the mouse cursor interacts with the current Entity.

The `Mouse` component cooperates with the [`Geometry`](#geometry) component in order to:

- Identify whether the mouse is "inside" the Entity
- Call event listeners with positions relative to the Entity's current position, rotation, and scale

If you do not provide a Mouse component with a specific Geometry component to use when it is created, then it will use [`Entity.getComponent`](/docs/api-core#getcomponent) to obtain one.

> If you need to convert an Entity-local position to a world position, you can use the following code snippet:
>
> ```ts
> const worldPoint = useEntityTransforms()
>   .matrixForWorldPosition()
>   .transformPoint(localPoint);
> ```
>
> And if you need to go the other way, you can use the following snippet:
>
> ```ts
> const localPoint = useEntityTransforms()
>   .matrixForWorldPosition()
>   .inverse()
>   .transformPoint(worldPoint);
> ```

```ts

### Ogmo.Level

> Available since version: 0.4.1

```ts
import { Ogmo } from "@hex-engine/2d";
Ogmo.Level;
```

A component representing a single Ogmo level. When created, it will loop over all the
layers, decals, tiles, entities, and grids in the level, and create appropriate objects
to represent each.

It cooperates with an Ogmo.Project component to get layer information and create entities
and decals.

You cannot create these manually; instead, use the `useLevel` method on [Ogmo.Project](#ogmoproject).

### Ogmo.Decal

> Available since version: 0.4.1

```ts
import { Ogmo } from "@hex-engine/2d";
Ogmo.Decal;
```

The default Ogmo decal component, used in the creation of decal entities
when rendering the [decal layer](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/docs/#/manual/decal-layers.md) of an Ogmo level.

It loads the image for the decal, and draws it with the position, rotation,
and scale specified by the decal data in the level.

If you want to use a different component to render decals, instead of this
one, then you can override it when you create the Ogmo.Project by passing
a custom function as its `decalFactory` parameter.

### Ogmo.TileRenderer

> Available since version: 0.8.0

```ts
import { Ogmo } from "@hex-engine/2d";
Ogmo.TileRenderer;
```

The default Ogmo tile renderer component, used to draw the [tile layers](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/docs/#/manual/tile-layers.md) of an Ogmo level.

It uses [`Ogmo.TileLayerParser`](#ogmotilelayerparser) to create a [`TileMap`](#tilemap) for the layer, then draws the layer offset such that its center will be at 0, 0.

If you want to use a different component to render tile layers, instead of this
one, then you can override it when you call [`Ogmo.Project`](#ogmoproject)'s
`useLevel` method by passing a component function as its `tileRenderer`
parameter.

### Ogmo.TileLayerParser

> Available since version: 0.8.0

```ts
import { Ogmo } from "@hex-engine/2d";
Ogmo.TileLayerParser;
```

A component that creates a [`TileMap`](#tilemap) component for a tile layer from
an Ogmo level.

This component is used by [`Ogmo.TileRenderer`](#ogmotilerenderer) which is the default
implementation for rendering tile layers from Ogmo levels. You may find
`Ogmo.TileLayerParser` useful if you are overriding the default TileRenderer
with a different implementation. To override it, pass a component function
to [`Ogmo.Project`](#ogmoproject)'s `useLevel` method as its `tileRenderer` parameter.

### Physics.Engine

### ProceduralSfx

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { ProceduralSfx } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

A Component that can be used to generate procedural sound effects,
by synthesizing modal sounds. A modal sound is a resonating, ringing
sound that is composed out of several different sine waves, such as
the sound that is emitted when you strike a wine glass or metal rod.

If you use a spectrogram to identify the frequency, amplitude, and decay rate
of the sine waves that the sound is made out of, then you can provide them
to this function, and it will create a model that synthesizes that sound.

If you then vary the frequency, amplitude, or decay rate slightly each time
the sound is played, you can get a rich bank of sound effects all from one sound.

```ts
function ProceduralSfx(
  modes: Array<{
    frequency: number;
    amplitude: number;
    decay: number;
  }>
): {
  /**
   * Returns the synthesis model, if it is available.
   *
   * To work around browsers disallowing sound to be played without the user interacting with
   * the page first, the synthesis model will not be created until the first time the user
   * clicks on the page, or presses a key. Until then, this will be `null`.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.1
   */
  synthesis: Object; // return type of makeModalSynthesis from the "modal-synthesis" package

  /**
   * Plays the sound, if the browser is allowed to play sound; browser disallow
   * webpages from playing sound until the first time the user interacts with the
   * page (via a click or keypress). So this method won't have an effect until after
   * the first time the user has clicked somewhere on the page, or pressed some key
   * on their keyboard.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.1

### SpriteSheet

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { SpriteSheet } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

A Component that helps you draw individual sprites from a sprite sheet.

It is designed to be used with an image that is laid out like a film strip,
with many sprites on it. Each sprite will be assigned an index from left-to-right,
top-to-bottom (if there are multiple rows in the sheet), and you can specify which
index should be drawn to the canvas.

````ts
function SpriteSheet(options: {
  /**
   * The image URL.
   *
   * You can get a URL for an image on disk by `import`ing it, as if it was code:
   *
   * ```ts

   *
   * console.log(typeof myImage); // "string"
   * ```
   *

### TextBox

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { TextBox } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

This Component lays out text in lines, fitting as many words as it can on
one line before continue onto the next. When you use it, it tells you which
lines it rendered, and which parts of the text you provided didn't fit into
the text box (if any). You can use this information to re-render the text
box with new content, once the user has read the text.

```ts
export default function TextBox(options: {
  /**
   * The font to use to draw text in this text box.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.0
   */
  font: ReturnType<typeof Font | typeof BMFont | typeof SystemFont>,

### TileMap

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { TileMap } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

This Component uses a Grid of tile indices and a SpriteSheet Component to draw a large map of tiles to the canvas.

```ts
function TileMap(
  sheet: ReturnType<typeof SpriteSheet>,
  grid: Grid<number>
): {
  /**
   * Draws all the tiles in this map into the canvas.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.1
   *
   * In versions prior to 0.0.1, this method was called `drawMapIntoContext`, and had a different signature.
   */
  draw(
    context: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
    position?: {
      x?: number | void;
      y?: number | void;
    } = {}
  ): void;
};
```

### Timer

> Available since version: 0.0.0
> Type changed in version: 0.10.0

```ts
import { Timer } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

This Component can be used to measure time.

```ts
// Create a timer
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
// Set it to some time in the future
timer.setToTimeFromNow(100);
// Use its `alpha` property to get a number from zero to one
// representing how close the current time is to the set time:
timer.alpha; // 0
// If you wait 50ms and then check again...
timer.alpha; // 0.5
// And 50 more ms...
timer.alpha; // 1
```

The `alpha` property is clamped from 0 to 1. If you want the "raw"
value, that goes above 1 after you've gone beyond the set time, use the
`unclampedAlpha` property instead:

```ts
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
timer.setToTimeFromNow(100);
timer.alpha; // 0
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 0
// If you wait 100ms and then check again...
timer.alpha; // 1
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 1
// And 50 more ms...
timer.alpha; // 1
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 1.5
// And 50 more ms...
timer.alpha; // 1
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 2
```

You can use `unclampedAlpha` to measure time elapsed in milliseconds:

```ts
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
timer.setToTimeFromNow(1);
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 0
// If you wait one ms and then check again:
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 1
// and, after waiting another ms:
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 2
```

Or, you can use `unclampedAlpha` to measure time elapsed in _seconds_:

```ts
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
timer.setToTimeFromNow(1000); // Pass 1000 here instead of 1
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 0
// If you wait one second and then check again:
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 1
// and, after waiting another second:
timer.unclampedAlpha; // 2
```

To pause a Timer, call its component `disable` function:

```ts
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
timer.disable(); // Pause the timer
```

While disabled, the Timer won't count time.

To resume a paused Timer, call its component `enable` function:

```ts
const timer = useNewComponent(Timer);
timer.disable(); // Pause the timer
// And then later:
timer.enable(); // Resume the timer
```

To reset the Timer's set time to a new time, call `setToTimeFromNow` again.

```ts
function Timer(): {
  /**
   * Sets the timer's internal "target" time to some time in the future.
   *
   * If you never call setToTimeFromNow, the target time of the timer will be
   * the time that the timer was created.
   *
   * Available since version: 0.0.1
   */
  setToTimeFromNow(msFromNow: number): void;

  /**
   * A number between 0 and 1 representing how close the current time is to
   * the set time. Immediately after calling `setToTimeFromNow`, it will
   * have the value 0. Once the amount of time passed into `setToTimeFromNow`
   * has elapsed, it will have the value 1. In the time in-between, its value
   * will be between 0 and 1.
   *
   * After the set time has elapsed, its value will remain at 1. For a value
   * that continues to grow above 1, use `unclampedAlpha`.
   */
  alpha: number;

  /**
   * Like `alpha`, but its value continues to grow beyond 1 after the set
   * time has elapsed.
   */
  unclampedAlpha: number;
};
```

## Hooks

`@hex-engine/2d` comes with several hook functions you can use within your own Component functions.

### useContext

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useContext } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useContext(): CanvasRenderingContext2D`

Returns the 2d rendering context of the root component's Canvas.

This is the same context that gets passed into `useDraw`'s callback.

### useDraw

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useDraw } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`export default function useDraw(onDraw: (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => void, { roundToNearestPixel: boolean }?): void`

Register a function to be called once per frame, after all `useUpdate` functions have been called.

The function will receive a 2d canvas context it can draw into.

The context you receive will already be rotated and translated such that position 0, 0 is the upper-left corner of the current Entity, so in most cases, you will not need to worry about x/y positioning.

### useUpdate

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useUpdate } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useUpdate(callback: (delta: number) => void): void`

Registers a function to be called once every frame, prior to drawing.

The function will receive a single argument, `delta`, which is the number of milliseconds
that have passed since the last frame was rendered.

### useEntitiesAtPoint

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useEntitiesAtPoint } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useEntitiesAtPoint(worldPos: Vector): Array<Entity>`

Get all the entities at the given world position,
sorted by reverse draw order, such that one that
gets drawn last (and is therefore on top) is the first in the array.

### useEntityTransforms

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useEntityTransforms } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useEntityTransforms(entity?: Entity): { matrixForWorldPosition: () => TransformMatrix, matrixForDrawPosition: () => TransformMatrix }`

Get the matrix transforms for the specified Entity, or the current Entity if no entity is provided.

### useFilledPixelBounds

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useFilledPixelBounds } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useFilledPixelBounds(context: CanvasRenderingContext2D): { minX: number; maxX: number; minY: number; maxY: number; }`

Searches through the provided canvas context for non-transparent pixels
and identifies a bounding box that contains them.

> Warning: This function is expensive. Avoid using it on every frame.

### useInspectorHoverOutline

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useInspectorHoverOutline } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useInspectorHoverOutline(getShape: () => Polygon | Circle)`

Sets up the Inspector so that when the current Entity or Component is hovered over,
the provided function will be called to get a shape that should be drawn onto the screen.

This function does nothing in release builds.

### useInspectorSelectEntity

> Available since version: 0.3.2

```ts
import { useInspectorSelectEntity } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useInspectorSelectEntity(getGeometry: () => Geometry)`

Sets up the Inspector to enable hovering and clicking on the current rendered Entity by calling the provided function to get a Geometry for the Entity. Only rendered Entities that use a Geometry component can be hovered/clicked on when the Inspector is in entity select mode.

This function does nothing in release builds.

### useRawDraw

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { useRawDraw } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useRawDraw(callback: (context: CanvasRenderingContext2D): void`

Registers a function to be called once a frame, after all `useUpdate` functions have been called.

Unlike `useDraw`, `useRawDraw` does _not_ transform the context by the current Entity's matrix transform.

In most cases, you should use `useDraw` instead of `useRawDraw`.

### useDebugOverlayDrawTime

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useDebugOverlayDrawTime } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useDebugOverlayDrawTime(): void`

This hook specifies to the default draw order sort function
that this Component's draw callbacks should be drawn last,
after everything else, because this component renders debug overlay(s)
that should be drawn on top of everything else.

If you are using a custom draw order sort and want to preserve this functionality,
you can use the `Canvas.DrawOrder.isDebugOverlay` function to identify Components
that have called this hook.

### useCanvasDrawOrderSort

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useCanvasDrawOrderSort } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

This component will check the root Entity for a Canvas.DrawOrder component, and if it is present, it will return its `sort` function. Otherwise, it returns `Canvas.DrawOrder.defaultSort`.

### useFirstClick

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useFirstClick } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useFirstClick(handler: () => void): void`

This function will run the provided function the first time a mouse click occurs.
Note that it only works if there is at least one `Mouse` or `LowLevelMouse` Component
loaded in your game when the first click occurs. To be on the safe side, you should
probably also add a LowLevelMouse or Mouse Component to the Component that calls useFirstClick.

### useFirstKey

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useFirstKey } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useFirstKey(handler: () => void): void`

This function will run the provided function the first time a key is pressed.
Note that it only works if there is at least one `Keyboard` Component loaded in
your game when the first keypress occurs. To be on the safe side, you should
probably also add a Keyboard Component to the Component that calls useFirstKey.

### useAudioContext

> Available since version: 0.0.1

```ts
import { useAudioContext } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useAudioContext(): AudioContext | null`

Retrieve the current AudioContext from the root Entity's `AudioContext` component, if any.

### useCanvasSize

> Available since version: 0.1.15

```ts
import { useCanvasSize } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useCanvasSize(): Object`

Returns an object with three properties on it:

- `canvasSize: Vector`: A Vector that will get mutated such that it always equals the current canvas size
- `onCanvasResize(() => void): void`: A function that lets you register
  a function to be run every time the canvas size changes.
- `resizeCanvas: ({ realWidth: number | string, realHeight: number| string, pixelWidth: number, pixelHeight: number }) => void`: A function that resizes the canvas.

### useWindowSize

> Available since version: 0.1.15

```ts
import { useWindowSize } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

`useWindowSize(): Object`

Returns an object with two properties on it:

- `windowSize: ReadOnlyVector`: A Vector that will get mutated such that it always equals the window size (so you shouldn't mutate it)
- `onWindowResize(() => void): void`: A function that lets you register
  a function to be run every time the window size changes.

## Other

### Preloader

> Available since version: 0.0.0

```ts
import { Preloader } from "@hex-engine/2d";
```

An object that helps ensure used resources are loaded before they are used.

When resources that must be fetched over the network are created (such as Images and Audio),
they register themselves with thie Preloader. To wait until all registered resources have been
loaded, use `Preloader.load().then(() => {})`.

#### Methods

##### addTask

> Available since version: 0.0.0

`addTask(task: () => Promise<any>): void`

Adds a new task to the Preloader. It will start running immediately.

##### load

> Available since version: 0.0.0

`load(): Promise<void>`

Returns a Promise which does not resolve until all tasks that have been added to the Preloader have resolved.
