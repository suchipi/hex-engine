        ⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️

        Hex Engine is a 2D Game Engine for the browser, written in TypeScript. It is designed to feel similar to [React](https://reactjs.org/).

        Hex Engine implements a variant of the popular [Entity-Component-System model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), adapting it to make Components radically composable. In Hex Engine, every Component is a function, and Components can call special Hook functions to define their behavior in the game engine.

        Hex Engine comes out-of-the-box with a powerful development inspector and a modern frontend code compilation pipeline.

        Out of the box, Hex Engine has:

        - 2D rendering via HTML5 Canvas
        - Support for sprite sheets and animations
        - Helpers for sound playback and synthesization
        - Physics (via [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/))
        - Mouse, Keyboard, and Gamepad input
        - First-class support for popular indie game development tools [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and [BMFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/)
        - And much, much, more

        Hex Engine is inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Impact](https://impactjs.com/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

        Hex Engine was created by yours truly, Lily Skye. I am known throughout the JavaScript Open-Source community as one of the core maintainers of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and I have also contributed to a myriad of other well-known projects, including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools).

        I built Hex Engine because I felt that the browser game engine space could benefit a lot from technologies and patterns found in the open-source JavaScript frontend and tooling communities.

        It is the culmination of years of research, and probably the fifth or sixth game engine I have written for the browser (but the first that I've been proud enough of to share).

        All that said, it's far from done- I'm hoping that we can form a community together and make something we can all be proud of.

  //       Hex Engine's design encourages composable, re-usable, flexible code.

  //       Written some game logic and decided that you want to re-use it in another Entity?
  //       No problem, just copy the code out into a function, then \`import\` it everywhere you
  //       want it. Since you don't need to conform to rigid class interfaces with Hex Engine,
  //       you can organize your code however you like- and share it with your friends to use
  //       in their projects.

  //       Hex Engine is both powerful *and* easy to get started with.

  //       You'll find everything you need out of the box to make simple 2D games-
  //       a physics engine, asset loading, rendering, input handling, and so on. But
  //       for anything you need that's not built into the engine, Hex Engine provides
  //       you with the same tools it's built out of to make your own additions.
  //       Plus, thanks to the first-class TypeScript support, your editor will
  //       help you understand what each piece of Hex Engine does.
