## How to contribute

Hex Engine greatly appreciates pull requests, but open an issue first to check if the change you want to make is in line with the project vision. Once you have, you can follow these instructions to clone the repo and work on it locally.

### Install the project

First, you need to fork the repository. For information about forking a repository, you can check [this GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

Once you have forked the repo, use the following command to clone it onto your local machine (replacing `<your-github-user-name>` with your GitHub username).

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/hex-engine.git
```

Afterwards, `cd` into the newly-created `hex-engine` folder, and install the dependencies. You can install the dependencies with this command:

```
npm install
```

Now you can run the Hex Engine project with the following command:

```
npm start
```
